    "### Lab Report: Network and System Administration Practice (Exercise 02)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Objective\n",
    "The goal of this lab was to create a simple network service daemon and implement communication between a client and server. The tasks included:\n",
    "- Creating a daemon in C that listens on a specific port.\n",
    "- Connecting a client to the server and receiving a welcome message.\n",
    "- Modifying the code to adapt to the required port and IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Environment\n",
    "- **Server IP Address**: 192.168.5.100  \n",
    "- **Client IP Address**: 192.168.5.102  \n",
    "- **Port Number**: 14052  \n",
    "- **Tools Used**: GCC compiler, terminal (Shell)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Steps Performed\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Modification**\n",
    "   - Changed the port number in both `server.c` and `client.c` to `14052`.\n",
    "   - Set the destination IP address in `client.c` to `192.168.5.100`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compilation**\n",
    "   - Compiled the client code on the local machine:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     gcc -o client client.c\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Compiled the server code on the server:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     gcc -o server server.c\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Server Execution**\n",
    "   - Ran the server program on the server:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     ./server\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - The server started listening on port `14052`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Client Execution**\n",
    "   - Ran the client program on the local machine:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     ./client\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - The client successfully connected to the server and received the welcome message:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Received \"Welcome to this wonderful server.\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Server Output**\n",
    "   - The server output the following:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Incoming connection from 192.168.5.102\n",
    "     New message: \"This is the client speaking !\"\n",
    "     Closing connection from 192.168.5.102\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Results\n",
    "- A successful client-server communication was established.\n",
    "- The server correctly listens on the specified port and responds to client requests.\n",
    "- The client successfully receives the welcome message from the server.\n",
    "- The server closes the connection properly after the client disconnects.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Conclusion\n",
    "This lab successfully implemented a basic TCP server-client communication model using C programming. Through this exercise, the fundamental steps of network programming, including port listening, data transmission, and connection closing, were understood. Further enhancements, such as multi-client support, configuration file reading, or UNIX socket integration, can be explored as per the lab instructions.\n"
